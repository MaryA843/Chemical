    "**Business Context.** You are an analyst at the ICCT ([International Council on Clean Transportation](https://theicct.org/mission-history)), an NGO that provides research to environmental authorities around the world. You are part of a team that is preparing a report on the alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) market in the United States, with a particular focus on the state of Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your job is to **provide a characterization of the AFV market in the US and in Washington, including data about energy efficiency of the vehicles over time, geographical distribution, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You will be working with three Excel files that contain the raw data. The first one is  [`us_sales_fellow.xlsx`](data/us_sales_fellow.xlsx), which contains aggregated sales figures for the US; the second one is [`us_ranges_fellow.xlsx`](data/us_ranges_fellow.xlsx), which has data about ranges of electrical vehicles. These data files come from the US Department of Energy. The last one is [`washington_evs_fellow.xlsx`](data/washington_evs_fellow.xlsx), which is a census of all the electric vehicles in circulation in Washington state. This census data comes from the Washington State Department of Licensing.\n",

    "[Alternative fuel vehicles (AFV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel_vehicle) are vehicles that run either partially or totally on an energy source that is not gasoline or diesel, such as ethanol, solar power, electricity, or hydrogen. Some AFVs are highly efficient and, perhaps more importantly, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional vehicles, which makes them an important part of environmental recovery and protection plans around the globe.\n",

PEVs come in third (3.7%), with an equal split between the PHEVs(1.72%) and the EVs(1.98%). The smalllest sector are CNGs, taking up 0.11% of the population of cars.

    "> Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and are capable of operating on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83%. E85 (or flex fuel) is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol, depending on geography and season. According to IHS Markit, as of 2017, there were more than 21 million FFVs in the United States. Because FFVs are factory made and are capable of operating on gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends, many vehicle owners don't realize their car is an FFV and that they have a choice of fuels to use.\n",

But taking this information into considerations, you could imply that Americans do not have to rely on gasoline to run their vehicles. In fact, most Americans might not even be aware that they own an FFVs. This means that they could potentially not purchase high priced gasoline and deal with the detrimental effects it has on the environment. The pie-chart actually tells a wrong and skewed story."

In 2011, EVs and PHEVs made a relatively equal amount of sales, but in the 2012 PHEVs triumphed over EVs in sales by about 250,000 units. In 2013, their sales matched again, totaling about 500,000 units each. An interesting shift happened in 2014, EVs started to outsell PHEVs. And those sales exponetially increased in the coming years, resulting in EVs selling about 3 times as much as PHEVs in 2019. Electric vehicles reign supreme over plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the past decade."

    "-------The gap in the interval from ~147 to ~228 miles means that there are no models that can travel beyond those miles, without needing to be recharged. It seems that the models that go from ~228 miles and beyond are mostly Telsas. Teslas has been a pioneer in the electric vehicle industry for a long time, so they have vested interest and enough research capabilities to create vehicles with longer ranges. The models in the ~147 to ~228 gap must be created by makes with little knowledge about electric vehicles. Technology seems to be a contributing factor. Another important facet that might make up for the two distinct clusters of low electric range cars and high electric cars is the cost for value. Consumers might not think that the cost for a mid-range car is worth it, thus manufacturers are keeping that in mind creating models. People  either go for the high-range Teslas or they go the low-range models."
